# Ocarina

Ocarina is a collection of style guides for [Kick Interactive](http://www.wearekick.co.uk) written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and JavaScript.


## Documentation

The documentation for these style guides is built for [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), which uses the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

### Installation

To run this locally you will need Ruby version 2.0.0, or higher.

```
# Check version of Ruby
ruby -v
```
If it returns a lower number or don't have Ruby installed, you can get version 2 using [RVM](https://rvm.io) or directly from the [Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

You will also need to have NodeJS. This can be installed using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or directly from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have these you will need to install the project's dependencies.

```
npm install
```

### Developing

npm start
```
